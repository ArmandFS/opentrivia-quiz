# opentrivia-quiz
Hi! This is one of my first personal python projects that I will be uploading here to Github.

This is a simple class based Tkinter Quiz App! This python application utilizes Tkinter for the GUI and uses the Open Trivia API for the questions.  I've referenced this from the 100 Days of Python Udemy Course that is available on Udemy.

You can directly change how many questions you want in the quiz_data.py file by changing the parameters!
and if you want more settings such as categories, difficulty, and others, changed it here:

Have Fun!
